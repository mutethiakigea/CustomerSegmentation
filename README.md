### Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, to segment customers based on key attributes such as income, age, spending score, and loyalty status.

### Technologies Used
+ Frontend: React.js is employed to create an interactive and user-friendly application, allowing clients to engage seamlessly with the system.
+ Backend: Flask serves as the backend framework, providing a robust API for communication between the React application and the underlying data processing.
### Features
1) Customer segmentation based on multiple criteria <br/>
2) Interactive user interface for easy navigation and data input <br/>
3) API integration for real-time data processing and response
